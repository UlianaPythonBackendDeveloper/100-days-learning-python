# In Python,
*args is a special syntax used in a function definition to pass a variable number of non-keyword (positional) arguments to that function. The arguments are collected into a tuple inside the function. 
## Key Concepts

    Variable Number of Arguments: It is used when you don't know in advance how many positional arguments will be passed to your function.
    Tuple Formation: Inside the function, the arguments are accessible as a tuple named args (by convention, the name args is arbitrary; the * is the important part).
    Convention: The name args (short for arguments) is the standard convention used in Python documentation and community. 
    
    
    
       
       
       
       
 # method count

##  The count() method in Python is used to determine the number of occurrences of a specific element within a sequence (such as a string, list, or tuple). 

# Method replace
##  In Python, the primary method for replacing a substring within a string is the built-in .replace() method. It returns a new string with the replacements applied, as the original string remains unchanged due to string immutability.
