## str.join(iterable)
### The Python string
join() method is used to concatenate all items from an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) into a single string, using a specified separator string. It is a string method, meaning you call it on the separator string itself, not the iterable. 
## Syntax
The basic syntax for the join() method is:
python

separator.join(iterable)

    separator: The string used to separate the elements in the final combined string.
    iterable: The collection of items you want to join. All items in the iterable must be strings.
